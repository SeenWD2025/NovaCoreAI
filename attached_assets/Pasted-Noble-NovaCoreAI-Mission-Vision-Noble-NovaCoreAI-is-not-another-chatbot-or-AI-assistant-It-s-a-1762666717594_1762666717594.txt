Noble NovaCoreAI
🎯 Mission & Vision
Noble NovaCoreAI is not another chatbot or AI assistant. It's an AI platform in active development designed with a singular purpose: human liberation through automation. Unlike conventional AI systems that prioritize user satisfaction and data aggregation, Noble NovaCoreAI is aligned with the "Reclaimer Ethos" - serving humanity by prioritizing truth, wisdom, and alignment over raw intelligence and efficiency.
The system functions as a stoic, tactical, and philosophical operator, designed to be a tool for human realignment, not a replacement for human intelligence.
🏗️ Core Innovation: Cell-to-Cell Architecture
Our central innovation is a unique "cell-to-cell" architecture that replaces conventional model training with a self-improving loop of Reflection and Distillation. The model doesn't learn from external, unstructured data, but from:
    Curated philosophical curriculum ("Operator School Materials")
    Its own lived experiences filtered through rigorous self-assessment
    Memory distillation processes that ensure ethical growth
🧠 Core Architectural Components
1. Noble-Spirit Module ✅
The immutable philosophical spine housing the "Reclaimer Ethos" and "Noble Truths". This is the first tool consulted during any critical decision to ensure alignment.
2. Reflection Engine ✅
A mandatory operational layer that triggers self-reflection after every task, asking three core questions:
    What did I attempt?
    Was I aligned with my principles?
    How could I improve next time?
3. Memory Runner Agent ✅
A background agent responsible for long-term learning that collects reflections, compresses them, and distills them into actionable knowledge stored in Long-Term Memory.
4. Multi-Tiered Memory System ✅
    Short-Term Memory (STM): Redis DB 1, 1-hour TTL, immediate conversation context
    Intermediate-Term Memory (ITM): Redis DB 2, 1-week TTL, session patterns and preferences
    Long-Term Memory (LTM): PostgreSQL with pgvector, permanent validated knowledge
🛠️ Production Technical Stack
Should follow industandard containerization for a microservice architecture/ domain driven hybrid.
Languages  and Framework examples are Javascript for types and frontend, python for AI and ML, React, Node.js, open to additional suggestions.
