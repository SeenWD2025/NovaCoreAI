Vibe coding and app development for amature education module/feature set
The goal is to provide a clean and modern UI/UX experience to users while the learn the basics and intermediate skills required for successful vibe coding and app development projects. 
This should be education have and feature the latest industry recognized information, tips, tricks, and advice. The feature should also seamlessly integrate wih the rest of the project
and seem natural as a component of the NovaCoreAI platform rather than a seperate app. Maintain consistency with frontend styling of the rest of the app and existing codebase. 

Example: Building with Replit- from idea to revenue-generating platform
    In February, Jon set himself a challenge: build a business and get his first customer within 48 hours. While he missed his ambitious deadline by a day, the results were extraordinary. In just three days, he built the General AI Proficiency Institute (GenAIPI)—a comprehensive platform featuring:
    AI Proficiency Assessment: A sophisticated testing system that evaluates users' AI knowledge and skills
    Learning Management System: Complete with courses, modules, lessons, and quizzes
    Live Course Booking: Calendar integration for 16-person cohorts
    Certification System: Automated PDF certificate generation with unique IDs
    Admin Dashboard: Full user management, content management, and analytics
    Payment Processing: Integrated Stripe APIs for seamless transactions
    Complex Logic: Test scoring algorithms, progress tracking, and multi-tier access controls
    "I built an admin section that lets me manage users, look at course content, change content, manage live course schedules, participants, course reviews," Jon explains. "Even viewing test results and the ability to generate certificates."

    Value Realized: Transforming Business Creation
    The impact extends far beyond Jon's own success. His platform now teaches others to replicate his results through courses like "How to Build a Business in a Weekend with AI."

I wooul like to create a similar feature/service/s with a focus on app development and vibe coding. The goal is to take an amature user from no-knowledge through the process of identifing the poblem/s they want to solve with the app, 
architectural planning and considerations, choosing an IDE, chosing AI models, Specife model use cases where they accel, understanding AI agents, Prompt engineering Basics, Advanced prompt engineering and personas, test and end to end user journeys, 
and finally deployment.
The feature should be structured and feel similar to NGS and gamified, but with a different intended outcome.
